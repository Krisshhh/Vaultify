# FileVault Setup Instructions

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

1. **Performance improvements** - Added proper middleware and optimized queries
2. **Tab functionality** - All tabs now work with proper data loading
3. **File download issues** - Fixed download functionality to maintain files in vault
4. **Added file sharing** - Complete file sharing system between users
5. **Admin dashboard** - Role-based access with analytics
6. **CAPTCHA integration** - Replaced OTP with CAPTCHA for regular users

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure reCAPTCHA (Important!)
1. Go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create
2. Create new site with:
   - **Type:** reCAPTCHA v2 "I'm not a robot"
   - **Domains:** `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, your production domain
3. Copy your keys to `.env`:
   ```
   CAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_site_key_here
   CAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   ```

### 3. Create Admin User
Run this in MongoDB shell or MongoDB Compass:
```javascript
// First create a regular user account through signup
// Then promote to admin:
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "admin@yourdomain.com" },
  { $set: { role: "admin" } }
)
```

### 4. Test the System

4. Login with CAPTCHA (no OTP needed)
5. Access dashboard with all tabs working

#### Admin Flow:
1. Click "Admin Login" on login page
2. Enter admin credentials
3. Receive OTP via email
4. Access admin dashboard with analytics

#### File Sharing Flow:
1. Upload files in "My Files" tab
